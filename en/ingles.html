                    <li>Videogames</li>
                    <p>I love any type of videogames and i
                        always have a great time when i enjoy
                        these as there is a wide diversity of
                        fantastic scenarios that in real life
                        would be imposible to see, besides they
                        help me to distract from de bad things
                        and the problems in reality or when something
                        goes wrong and allows me to relax to have a clear
                        mind so i can face them later.
                    </p>
                    <li>Go out</li>
                    <p>I love to go out to discover new and interesting
                        places, but i enjoy this even more when i am in
                        company of friends or relatives, because i think that
                        having all those memories and experiences it's much
                        better with the people you love and appreciate, for
                        what they are remembered with more affection. And even
                        though I haven't been able to travel as much as I would
                        like i hope in the future to know much more.
                    </p>
                    <li>Read comics</li>
                    <p>Before had started reading comics in an app but i left it
                        and it was recently that i resumed it in my free times or
                        when i have to wait in line in some places and has me
                        fascinated since the comics that people create of that app
                        are incredible and have some stories that managed to hook me a
                        lot and as each time they come out more, there will be always
                        something new to read.
                    </p>
                    <li>Learn new things</li>
                    <p>I think whenever you can learn something new it is something
                        very good as it allow us to expand our knowledges on various
                        topics, i say that we should never lose the interest to learn
                        something new, besides who knows maybe we can discover something
                        that we like but we didn't knew about its existence or how it
                        could work.

                    <li>Mathematics</li>
                    <p>I have almost always been good at numbers but despite this the
                        topics i have seen recently are more dificult, but anyway i manage
                        to understand them and i review them many times to have them clear
                        and i have begun to like mathematics and i found interesting the
                        various topics that this ones have to offer.
                    </p>
                    <li>English</li>
                    <p>English is a language that I am very good at and i really like the way
                        it is and the way it is spoken, so i can have conversations, read
                        text, write y something that i really like are slangs as i find them
                        very fun to use, in addition knowing english has allowed me to talk
                        with more people and meet new persons. It also helped me to search
                        for information on the internet that's only found in english.
                    </p>
                    <li>Listen and understand the others</li>
                    <p>There are times when something happens to the people i know and they
                        want to tell someone about it and i like to be there for them when
                        they need it and let them vent, tell what happened to them and let
                        them know that i and many more people are there to support them no
                        matter what happens.
                    </p>
                    <li>Fast learner</li>
                    <p>When i don't know something and i want to learn it, when searching about
                        it, clearly at the beginning is complicated but if i dedicate and i
                        propose to learn that i end up achieving it and as i pick up the rhythm
                        it becomes easier to understand and i can move on to more advanced topics
                        related to what i'm learning and to be able to master the topics better
                        every time.

                    <li>Programming</li>
                    <p>I started not long ago but I have some knowledge about how to program in
                        a Frontend way and how to make a basic web page using Html and Css so far
                        but later i am going to use JavaScript to make it look much more professional.

                    <li>Music</li>
                    <p>I have some knowledges about music, its various genres and the structure
                        of the piano and what this entails such as notes, flats, sharps, the treble
                        clef that corresponds to the right hand and the bass clef that corresponds
                        to the left, in addition i have searched for information and I have seen
                        several videos about it, but these are just some basci knowledges, to
                        master these, it requires practice of the instrument.

                    <p>Be updated on new things that are coming out or news about some inventions

                        such as devices, new components, new ways in which new technology is
                        implemented, how they use it to revolutionize industries such as film,those
                        of video games, digital art, etc.
                    </p>
                    <li>Culture and history</li>
                    <p>Lately I have traveled on some school excursions and learned more about
                        the culture and history of the country in places like universities, museums
                        and of course the various festivities that are celebrated in the country
                        and that are of great importance to the population.

                        attract attention, also because i will feel happier and more encouraged to
                        do these and it will not bother me to do it so i will do it in a better way.

                    <li>Have a business</li>
                    <p>In the futures when it is possible, be able to create my own business that is
                        fascinating and that makes both employees and customers feel satisfied with
                        the way they are treated, as well as the innovative way in which things are
                        done and clearly that the business is something that i want, wish to do and

                    <p>Although things don't always go well and i can get frustrated i
                        usually try to look at things on the positive side and see if
                        somehow i could take advantage of what happened and manage to
                        remedy the situation.

                    <li>Enthusiast</li>
                    <p>I show the best attitude to do the things that are proposed and
                        that they are complete in a satisfactory and successful way, since
                        having an adequate attitude for what is presented helps that there
                        is a better environment and motivate yourself and others.

                    <li>Thoughtful</li>
                    <p>Against the various problems that can be presented to us to try to see it
                        from different points of view to achieve the best possible solution to the
                        dilemmaal and that it does not affect, as far as possible, other aspects of
                        which it is doing either an activity, project or something else.
                    </p>
                    <li>Pacient</li>
                    <p>That if something does not happen or we have to wait for it to be done, work
                        or something like that I am patient because if you get desperate it could
                        cause a problem or become restless when doing something, which would make
                        it difficult to think about properly about how you should do what is proposed.
